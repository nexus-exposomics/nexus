    "text": "** Note: this was originally published at Open Access Government on October 3rd, 2024.\nThe sequencing of the human genome was heralded as a major scientific achievement that would revolutionize medicine by identifying genetic causes of disease, which could then be cured using gene therapy. However, while genomic research has identified numerous genetic variants in the human genome that confer risk for disease, it has become increasingly clear that only a small fraction of disease can be attributed solely to genetic causes. Indeed, genetic evidence indicates a critical role for diverse environmental factors in determining an individual’s health throughout their life.\nThese environmental influences include the chemical, physical, and social environments in which people live and the impact of these environments on their opportunities and health behaviors. Put another way, environmental factors that influence human health can be exogenous (e.g., originating from outside the body, such as environmental pollutants, climate, noise, and light), endogenous (e.g., within the body, like the microbiome, metabolism, pre-existing medical conditions) and behavioral (e.g., lifestyle, stress). Tracking the complexity of environmental factors experienced by an individual across their lifetime to identify those that modify health is a significant scientific challenge. However, recent advances in the rapidly evolving field of exposomics offer an exciting opportunity for not only comprehensively cataloging human exposures across the lifespan but also linking them to biological responses that determine health and disease.\nIn December 2023, investigators representing diverse research fields and expertise convened at the Banbury Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to develop an updated and unified definition of the exposome. (1) The consensus definition reached during this meeting was that the exposome is the integrated compilation of all physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial influences that impact biology. Exposomics was defined as the field that studies the comprehensive and cumulative effects of the exposome on biological systems by integrating data from a variety of interdisciplinary methodologies and data streams. In contrast to more traditional environmental health or psychosocial research that has largely focused on the effects of a specific environmental factor on a particular outcome at a given point in time, exposomics is explicitly, and, by definition, multifactorial with the goal of enabling discovery-based analysis of environmental influences on health across the lifespan.\n\n\n\nWhile the tools for exposomics are rapidly evolving, many are currently available and ‘research-ready.’ Examples include high-resolution mass spectrometry for the detection of environmental chemicals and metabolic perturbations, epigenomics to measure environmentally mediated alterations to the genome, and geospatial techniques for mapping the proximity of individuals to exposure sources. Recent studies integrating exposomics with genomics have revealed exciting new discoveries regarding the etiologies of some of the most debilitating human diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, lung disease, and diabetes.\nEspecially promising is the application of exposomics to understand the root causes of health disparities and adverse health impacts of climate change. Numerous factors are known to contribute to health disparities, including suboptimal nutrition, exposure to chemical pollutants, and psychosocial stress. Climate change also disproportionately impacts disadvantaged communities via extreme heat conditions, vector-borne disease, and insecurity around food and housing. Although some of these environmental influences cannot be quantified using classical biochemical measurements, there are molecular signatures like altered stress pathways and epigenetic modifications that can be readily quantified using currently available exposomic technologies. Thus, exposomics will improve our ability to systematically identify the upstream drivers and molecular transducers of environmental impacts on health to help define strategies for achieving health equity at individual and population levels.\nFor exposomics to be incorporated into the biomedical enterprise, the field must develop a toolbox that is readily accessible and deployable by those not familiar with the methods. In addition to developing training programs in exposomics, the Banbury Exposomics Consortium outlined five additional focus areas that would propel the field forward: (1) develop advanced biomedical measurement technologies (for blood, tissue, or environmental samples) and strategies for their integration with other omic (e.g., genomics, metabolomics, etc.) technologies and use at the point of care; (2) establish new methods to estimate individual exposures over the life-course that can be applied in research, public health, and clinical applications; (3) create a human exposome reference map enabling analysis at the population scale to support epidemiological research and policy decisions; (4) develop wearable or minimally-invasive tools that measure an individual’s exposome and develop strategies for commoditization; and (5) create a framework for the standardization and harmonization of language, protocols, data collection, and data analysis methods, as well as best practices, including quality control and quality assurance, in order to maximize the value of data in a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) format.\n\n\n\nIt was also recognized by the Banbury Exposomics Consortium that widespread adoption of exposomics requires attention to the ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA) of its use, similar to what the field of genomics faced decades ago. There are many questions that need to be addressed about the value and consequences of exposomics research across many sectors. For example, how does the field preserve privacy while capturing residential, school, and occupational history for geospatial analysis? How do investigators prevent exposome data from being misused? What is the moral imperative if exposomics can unequivocally detect a negative impact related to living in a particular city or part of town? How do we prevent discrimination based on one’s exposome profile?\nIn summary, the Human Genome Project launched in 1990 revolutionized biomedical research, enabling significant conceptual and technical advances in genetics, omics technologies, database infrastructures, etc. Exposomics is poised to build upon the advances made in genomics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of human health and disease. The incentive to invest in exposomics is significant: many of the factors of the exposome, in contrast to the genome, may be modifiable and thus present novel strategies for preventing or curing disease at both the individual and population level.\n\n\n\nCold Spring Harbor in Early Winter\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Banbury Exposomics Consortium.

    "text": "Along with the NIEHS, we are leading a center and a movement in understanding how our environments, or the exposome, shape human health. The concept of the “exposome” was first introduced by Dr. Christopher Wild in 2005 to encompass the wide array of exposures—chemical, social, physical, and more—that we encounter over our lifetimes. But where others saw an impossible challenge, we are seeing now with NEXUS an opportunity to reshape the field.\nNEXUS zeroes in on what truly matters: the factors that have the greatest impact on health and can be measured with today’s cutting-edge technology. Our mission is to revolutionize how the biomedical and public health communities think about environmental drivers of disease by creating new tools, investigator research networks, and methods that make exposomics a core part of scientific and biomedical research.\nThis center is sponsored by the NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS),National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), and the Office of Research on Women’s Health (ORWH).\nThe grant number is U24ES036819 in response to the NIH funding announcement RFA-ES-23-010. For more information on support, please see NIH RePORTER.\n\n\nNEXUS is more than just a coordination effort for current research—our goal is to transform the entire biomedical enterprise. By operationalizing exposomics, we’re integrating environmental data into all types of research, and achieving the genomics scale to identify the balance between genetic and environmental influences on health. We believe that by better understanding the exposome, we can unlock the full potential of precision medicine and help solve some of the most pressing health challenges of our time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngaging Stakeholders & Supporting Innovation\nOur Administrative and Stakeholder Engagement Hub provides a solid foundation for all NEXUS activities. We connect researchers, policymakers, and funders, while coordinating scientific vision, logistical support, and resources to accelerate innovation in exposomics. Through workshops, disease-focused accelerators, and collaborative hubs, we’re creating a vibrant community of practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutting-Edge Exposomics Measurement\nOur ChemBio Analytical Sciences Hub is developing state-of-the-art tools and best practices to measure the exposome in both biological and environmental samples. From exposome kits to ring trials, we are standardizing the science of exposomics and making it more accessible to researchers everywhere, ensuring that the technology keeps advancing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Place-Based Exposures\nThe Geospatial Sciences Hub is pioneering new ways to study how our surroundings—both social and environmental—impact health. By developing a scalable geospatial data framework, we’re creating tools that help researchers and public health officials connect the dots between place-based exposures and health outcomes at both the population and personal levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the Future of Exposomics Data\nWith the NEXUS Data Sciences Hub, we’re building the digital infrastructure to support a new era of precision environmental health. By integrating informatics, AI, and machine learning, we’re creating a robust data ecosystem for exposomics research. Our goal is to plan for a large-scale Exposome-Wide Association Study (ExWAS) across multiple diseases and establish a human exposomics reference panel—unlocking vast new insights into how our environments shape health and how to design future exposomics studies.\n\n\n\nJoin Us in Transforming Health\nNEXUS is a bold effort to push the boundaries of what’s possible in environmental health science. By connecting a network of innovators and creating the tools to study the exposome, we’re working to ensure that the environmental factors driving health and disease are no longer overlooked. Join us in our mission to create a healthier future for all and contact us!"
